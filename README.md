# Tailwind Dashboard in R

A quick example to demonstrate a proof-of-concept creating a dashboard using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I made this dashboard by combining two the pre-built layouts from the [Tailwind Components library](https://tailwindui.com/components).

[See the live dashboard](https://dgkeyes.github.io/tailwind-dashboard/).
